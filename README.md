# QKD-Experimental-Data-Analysis
This Python program analyzes and visualizes experimental data from two QKD devices: The Quantum Entanglement Demonstrator and the IDQ QKD Cerberus. It calculates visibility from polarization correlations and compares Quantum Bit Error Rates (QBER) with and without eavesdropping, showing how the attacks affect the channel integrity.
